 - Done. test vendor css (bootrstrap) and js (carousel) 
 - keep images(done) and fonts(done) in src?



Ptoblems.

Notes on bundler.
Use _styleBlock.scss so the scss file won't processed by gulp. This way only one contanetaed scss file will be in build.
Production build command is 'gulp build-prod'.




 Environment does not reload style cnahges.
